# Project: Real-World Data Analysis

## Objective

The aim of this project is to perform a comprehensive real-world data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Correspondence Factor Analysis (CFA) and to provide an interpretation of the results. Each group is required to submit a written report detailing each step of their analysis, explicitly highlighting the individual contributions of each group member. The assessment will consider the report's significance, form, content, relevance, and the oral presentation accompanied by a Q&A session. The oral evaluation will be personalized based on each participant's grasp of the subject matter and their ability to respond to questions.

## Guidelines

- **Data Selection:** Choose a dataset from any field containing at least 6 variables. The data should be current, dating back no earlier than 2010. Explain the reasons for your choice and define the problem you aim to investigate.

- **Data Analysis Execution:** Conduct the data analysis according to the chosen model (centered PCA, standardized PCA, CFA, etc.). The choice of the model should be explained. The report must include the results, specifying the tools used to obtain them (calculator, software, etc.). It should particularly highlight the representations on the chosen factorial planes, explaining the rationale behind these choices.

- **Interpretation:** Provide an interpretation of your analysis, possibly validating it with additional insights.

- **Conclusion:** Offer a general conclusion followed by an individual synthesis that may cover any challenges encountered, questions raised, etc.

- **Software Usage:** Utilize a data analysis software like XLSTAT for your analysis.

## Deliverables

1. **Written Report:** A comprehensive document detailing each step of the project, including data selection, analysis, and interpretation. The report must clearly articulate the individual contributions and the collective findings of the group.

2. **Oral Presentation:** A presentation of the project findings followed by a Q&A session. The presentation should effectively communicate the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.

3. **Individual Synthesis:** A personal reflection on the project experience, discussing any challenges faced, the learning outcomes, and the personal contribution to the project.

This project offers a practical opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of data analysis in a real-world context, enhancing understanding and skills in statistical analysis and interpretation.
